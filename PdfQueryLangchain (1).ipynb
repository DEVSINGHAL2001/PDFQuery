              "'I. Kozynap  \\n \\nKozynap  Ltd was founded by 3 of professionals who have come together to \\naddress one of the basic need of every human being -SLEEP.  \\nSleep is a simple tool which if used effectively can do loads to our well -being, \\nlike boosting immunity, reducing risks of lifestyle diseases such as Diabetes, \\nhypertension, heart diseases etc. Good sleep can boost metabolism, reduce \\nweight, improve memory, hormonal balancing  and many other health \\nbenefits.  \\nAll of us spend almost one third of our life sleeping, yet we pay least attention \\nto make ourselves aware about how to ensure “Good Sleep”  \\nWe realised that majority of the people were not clear about the aspects like \\nwhat kind and configuration of Mattress or pillows they should use, when it’s \\nthe time to change their mattress/pillows, which material is more suitable, \\nwhat level of firmness, what thickness is most suitable and so on……  \\nDue to lack of awareness and clarity people either end up either paying extra \\nand buying a product which may not be best suitable for them. This results in \\nsub-optimal support and comfort during their sleep. This affects their sleep \\nquality and ultimately their health.  \\nWe decided to bridge this need gap and provide good products at reasonable \\nprice to ensure that everyone can have Good Sleep and Great Health.  \\nWe feel that providing good products for good sleep, will be our contribution \\nto the society. It was this thought which made us quit our High profile jobs in \\nmost reputed organisations.  \\nThus “KOZYNAP” range of products was launched, which is a result of decades \\nof experience, research, inputs from experts who deals in Lifestyle disease \\nmanagement, inputs from Orthopaedics.  \\nSo rest assured “KOZYNAP” products are designed and manufactured for \\nensuring “Good Sleep. Great Health”  \\n \\n \\n 1. Why is it important to check the status of the mattress ? \\nWe spend one third of our life sleeping. It is during the sleep that our body \\nrejuvenates. Hence having a Good Sleep is of utmost importance for a Great \\nHealth. A bad mattress can cause a host of including back and neck pain and \\nunsatisfying sleep that leaves you tired all day. Experts recommends that \\nmattresses be replaced every 5 to 7 years, but many people sleep on a mattress \\nthat is giving them improper support and should be replaced sooner.  \\nIt is important to whether mattress you are using is best suited for you or not. \\nThere is a possibility that your mattress may not be a right fit you for several \\nreasons. The most common issue is that the mattress might not be providing \\nproper support to align your spine as you sleep, which causes you to wake up \\nwith discomfort, pain, or the need to stretch out kinks and stiffness. The mattress \\nmay also not have the right type or number of pressure relief layers, which can \\nleave you tossing and turning all night in an effort to ease the pressure and cause \\nyou to wake unrefreshed and still tired.  \\n \\n2. How do I know whether I should continue using my \\nmattress or look for changing ? \\n The best thing is to be aware about your feeling when you get up in the \\nmorning. If you feel one or more of the following points, it is worth considering \\nto look for a better mattress, viz :  \\nYou wake up feeling tired . You have been tossing and turning during the night . \\nYour mattress has sag more than 1” from its initial thickness level . Your mattress \\nhas lumps . You hear lot of cracking sound . You are having signs of allergies  \\n \\n3. What should I look for when buying a new mattress ? \\nThere are multiple variables like material ( Coir, Foam, Latex, Spring etc), Firmness \\nlevel ( Soft, medium, firm), Combination of layers, Price etc. This makes the \\nmattress buying bit confusing. To make a right choice, consider following factors : \\nLook for a mattress with the proper level of spinal alignment support for your \\nbody. When you lie on your back, you should not feel your back arch at all. \\nSomeone looking at you from a distance should see your head, hips and toes all \\nin line with each other, which probably means your shoulders and hips are settled \\ninto the mattress somewhat. There should not be space between your lower back \\nand your mattress.  Look for a mattress with the proper level of pressure relief for \\nyour body. When you lie on your side, you should not feel any pressure on your shoulder or hip.  Look for a mattress that isolates motion from one side of the \\nmattress to the other.  Be prepared to take your time and ask questions. Buying a \\nmattress shouldn’t be a rush decision but something you spend time looking into. \\nStart with a comfort test on good -quality mattresses and determine your comfort \\npreference. Try plush and firm mattresses to see which feels more comfortable \\nand supportive. Decide what you need to buy based on your preferences.  \\n \\n4. Which type of mattress is good for back pain ? \\nPeople who struggle with back pain want to find a mattress that is not -too-firm \\nand not -too-soft. A medium -firm mattress ensure that the user sink into the \\nmattress just the right amount so that the spine stays in proper neutral \\nalignment. Also, the mattress should feature good lumbar support, and this will \\nalso help prevent and alleviate  back pain . \\n \\n5. How to determine, if you need a soft mattress or a firm \\nmattress ? \\nThe best way to resolve this dilemma is to check the Spine Alignment. When our \\nspine is in its natural position, the neck, middle back and lower back are in \\nalignment. This means that your lungs are able to take in more oxygen, increasing \\ncirculation and relieving joint and muscle pains. On the contrary, poor alignment \\nduring sleep prevents the body from relaxing, therefore causing you to not only \\nget less sleep but feel poorly when you wake up the next morning. To ensure \\nyou’re getting your best sleep every night, choosing a mattress that is not too \\nfirm or too soft for your personal sleep style is key . \\n \\n6. What are the benefits of the soft mattress ? \\nWhile having a firmer mattress provides your bones with more resistance and \\nsupport, a softer mattress can give you the comfort and cushion you need to \\nsleep comfortably. Generally, softer mattresses are best for back and side \\nsleepers, as they conform to joints and the spine, providing you with enough \\ncushion and support . \\n \\n  \\n7. Is coir mattress good for health ? \\nCoir mattress gives good support to the body during sleep due to its natural \\nspring quality. It is made of natural, chemical free, non harmful material. It is \\ngood for sleep in addition to being eco friendly. It has an anti dust quality and is \\nthus good for those people having any kind of dust allergies. Coir mattress \\nensures good air circulation and has a natural cooling tendency . \\n \\n8. What is an Orthopaedic mattress ? \\nAn orthopedic mattress is a type of mattress that offers support to the joints. \\nOrthopedic mattresses are typically recommended for people who sleep with \\npain, people who are in active recovery from injury,  seniors and athletes or other \\npeople who are active. Orthopaedic mattress provides great support and spine \\nalignment. These mattress also helps in relieving pressure so that you don’t have \\npain build ups in pressure points and you feel more comfortable . \\n \\n9. Which Pillow is best for neck Pain ? \\nThe best pillow for neck and shoulder pain is firm enough to hold the head at a \\nhealthy angle, but soft enough to alleviate pressure points. It should have a good \\nbounce so that it fills up the contours of the neck . \\n \\n \\n10. Can a pillow cause neck pain ? \\nA pillow  that doesn’t support your head and  neck  properly  can create tension in \\nyour  neck  muscles, and  cause neck pain. Good quality fibre pillow which has a \\ngood bounce and fluffy feel or memory -foam  pillows  may allow your head to be \\n“cradled” at night, allowing for a neutral spine and  neck \\n \\n \\n 11. How to know when you should replace your pillow ? \\nA general rule  of thumb is to replace  your pillows  once every 1 -2 years. \\nYou’ll  know  it’s time for  a replacement when  your pillows  don’t provide enough \\nsupport. You should consider replacing your pillow when :  \\nYour pillow has noticeable lumpsIt is flat enough to foldYou have neck and \\nshoulder pain when you wake up in the morningYou often wake up tired.It smells \\nbadYou frequently wake up sneezing  \\n \\n12. What is the use of Mattress Protector ? \\nA mattress protector is an item of removable bedding that sits on top of, or \\nencases, a mattress to protect it. Some mattress protectors also provide \\nprotection to the person sleeping on the mattress from allergens and irritants \\nsuch as dust mites, bed bugs, mold, and dead  skin (like dandruf f) \\n '"
